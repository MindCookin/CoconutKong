About the game  :

Have you ever feed a Kong? Well, now you have the opportunity to do it! Rollover the screen and give our little kong ( I am not sure even what is it ) his favourite meal, a coconut!

Coconut Kong is a physics game inspired in old school arcade games. Simple and easy to use, like in the old times...

Have a good time!
